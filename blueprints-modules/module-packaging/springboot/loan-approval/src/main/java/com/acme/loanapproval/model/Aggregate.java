/**
 * The workflow aggregate: one entity per workflow instance, holding everything the
 * process needs to know. There are no process variables - this is the single source of
 * truth, and it stays a normal JPA entity your application can use like any other.
 *
 * <p>
 * The class is annotated {@code @NoSyncWithBPMS}, so none of its attributes is written to
 * the BPMS. Nothing in the model asks for one: the process runs from its start event
 * through a single service task to its end event, and there is no condition or timer to
 * evaluate. That is why no attribute carries {@code @SyncWithBPMS}. The BPMS is given the
 * aggregate's ID, which VanillaBP always shares because that is how it finds the workflow
 * again. The customer id and the rating stay in the application.
 * </p>
