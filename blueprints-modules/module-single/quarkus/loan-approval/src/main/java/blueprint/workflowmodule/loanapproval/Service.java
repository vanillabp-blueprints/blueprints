/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan approval,
 * expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP. Whenever the business case moves on, it tells {@link Workflow}
 * what happened, {@code loanRequested} rather than "start the process", and that class
 * decides what this means for the BPMN. The other direction runs through
 * {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}, which calls the methods below when the process reaches a
 * task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both directions meet here, and that is the point: this is the one class describing the
 * use case, and it does so without naming a single BPMN element.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the methods the API calls, because
 * starting a workflow has to run in a transaction and reading an entity needs one too. It
 * is deliberately absent from the methods a task handler calls: VanillaBP already runs a
 * task in a transaction it owns, and it commits that transaction for a
 * {@code TaskException} on purpose. A transaction declared here would roll back instead and
 * throw away what the handler wrote for the process to react to. VanillaBP sees the
 * transaction it can no longer commit and fails the task naming it, so the mistake shows up
 * rather than costing data.
 * </p>
