 * The API of this use case. It consists of GET requests only, so the process can be

 * <p>
 * The endpoint carrying the partner's answer is the callback a real partner would call.
 * That it happens to be a browser here changes nothing about its shape: an id, an answer,
 * and no knowledge of the BPMS.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The paths, the parameters and the answers come from {@link LoanApprovalApi}, the interface
 * the build generates from {@code src/main/resources/openapi/loan-approval.yaml}. This class
 * only implements it.
