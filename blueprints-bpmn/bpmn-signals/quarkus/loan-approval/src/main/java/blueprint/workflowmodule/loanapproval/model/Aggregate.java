/**
 * The workflow aggregate: one entity per workflow instance, holding everything the
 * process needs to know. There are no process variables - this is the single source of
 * truth, and it stays a normal JPA entity your application can use like any other.
 *
 * <p>
 * A signal shows the limit of what may travel: nothing at all. It is not addressed to a
 * workflow, so there is no aggregate the sender could write to beforehand. What a waiting
 * workflow needs is read from the application's data after the signal arrived - here from
 * {@link InterestRate} - and lands here.
